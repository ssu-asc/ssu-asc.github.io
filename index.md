# My name is Luiz Eduardo Amaral
### What am I?
I'm a Physicist with master's in Engineering and Materials Sciences and working in software development.

Currently I'm studying to become a `Data Scientist` and messing a little with `web development`.
Among the things I like there are *rock climbing*, *cycling* and *open source*.

My personal projects and other stuff are available in the bar above.

Feel free to pm me anytime in the links below <span style="font-size: 2em;">ðŸ˜‰</span>
