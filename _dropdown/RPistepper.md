RPistepper is a library containing:
* A class to control a stepper motor with a RPi.
* A function to execute a zig-zag motion with two motors.
* A function to execute a square_spiral motion with two motors.

## Wiring
In our setup, the power to the motors (Vm) is supplied with the 5V pins of the RPi, the grounding of the coils is controlled with a [ULN2803A](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/uln2803a.pdf) transistor array.

#### Conections RPi - ULN2803A:

| RPi Pin (BCM)| ULN2803A|
|--------------|---------|
|      17      |    1B   |
|      27      |    2B   |
|      10      |    3B   |
|      9       |    4B   |
|      14      |    5B   |
|      15      |    6B   |
|      23      |    7B   |
|      24      |    8B   |

#### Conections ULN2803A - Motors:

| ULN2803A| Motors          |
|---------|-----------------|
|    1C   | Motor_1 Coil_A1 |
|    2C   | Motor_1 Coil_A2 |
|    3C   | Motor_1 Coil_B1 |
|    4C   | Motor_1 Coil_B2 |
|    5C   | Motor_2 Coil_A1 |
|    6C   | Motor_2 Coil_A2 |
|    7C   | Motor_2 Coil_B1 |
|    8C   | Motor_2 Coil_B2 |

In this case, two motors were attached to the ULN2803A.


## Usage
### class Motor
This class allows the user to control a 6 pin stepper motor using 4 GPIO pins of a RPi.

Software uses BCM mode for pin indexing.

This class is best used with the 'with' statement to properly handle the cleanup of the GPIOs.

self.steps is a property of this class that will get the number of steps taken from the initial position or set to a specific step, similar to self.move.

In order to save power, it's advised to call self.release() when the motor is idle.

Arguments are a list with the 4 pins (Coil_A1, Coil_A2, Coil_B1, Coil_B2), the delay between steps (default = 20ms) and verbose to display reports on the motor movements, the last two are optional.
e.g:
```python
import RPistepper as stp
M1_pins = [17, 27, 10, 9]
with stp.Motor(M1_pins) as M1:
    for i in range(10):               # moves 20 steps,release and wait
        print M1
        M1.move(20)
        M1.release()
        raw_input('enter to execute next step')
```
If the class is instantiated normally, use the method `cleanup` prior to closing the application to close the GPIO resources.
Also, if it's important to go back to the initial position when finishing the routine, use the method `reset`.

```python
import RPistepper as stp
M1_pins = [17, 27, 10, 9]
M1 = stp.Motor(M1_pins)
for i in range(10):               # moves 20 steps,release and wait
    print M1
    M1.move(20)
    M1.release()
    raw_input('enter to execute next step')
M1.reset()
M1.cleanup()
```


#### Methods
Currently there are five implemented methods:
```python
def move(self, steps):
    '''
    Moves the motor 'steps' steps. Negative steps moves the motor backwards
    '''
```
```python
def release(self):
    '''
    Sets all pins low. Power saving mode
    '''
```
```python
def reset(self):
    '''
    Returns the motor to it's initial position
    '''
```
```python
def zero(self):
    '''
    Sets the motor to the next position which Coil_A1 and Coil_A2
    are on. Sets this position as the reference (steps = 0).
    '''
```
```python
def cleanup(self):
    '''
    Cleans the GPIO resources
    '''
```
The main method is `move`, which moves the motor the desired number of steps

#### steps property
It's possible to check the motor position or manually set the desired step using the `steps` property:
```python
import RPistepper as stp
M1_pins = [17, 27, 10, 9]
with stp.Motor(M1_pins) as M1:
    for i in range(10):               # moves 20 steps,release and wait
        print M1.steps
        M1.steps = 20*i
        M1.release()
        raw_input('enter to execute next step')
    M1.reset()
```
#### Attributes
This class haves the following attributes:

| Attribute    |  Data   |
|--------------|---------|
| DELAY        | Time between steps           |
| VERBOSE      | Display motor data on screen |
| PINS         | GPIOs used by the instance   |
| actual_state | A list with the status of the coils (on/off) |

### functions
These two functions executes pre determined movements and requires two stepper motor objects:
```python
def zig_zag(motor1, motor2, amp1, amp2, delay=None):
    '''
    Executes a zig-zag movement with two RPistepper objects.
    Arguments are: motor1 and motor2 objects and amp1, amp2, the amplitude
    of movement, a tuple (step, rep) representing the number of steps per
    iteration and the number of iterations of the following algorithm:
        Repeat rep1 times:
            1. Moves motor 2 step2*rep2 steps forward
            2. Moves motor 1 step1 steps forward
            3. Moves motor 2 step2*rep2 steps backwards
            4. Moves motor 1 step1 steps forward
        Reset to initial state
        Release the motors
    It's possible to change the delay between steps with the 'delay' argument
    '''
```
```python
def square_spiral(motor1, motor2, amplitude, delay=None):
    '''
    Executes a square spiral movement with two RPistepper objects.
    Arguments are: motor1 and motor2 objects and the amplitude of movement,
    a tuple (step, rep) representing the number of steps per iteration and
    the number of iterations of the following algorithm:
        for i in range(rep):
            1. Moves motor 2 to position i
            2. Moves motor 1 to position i
            3. Moves motor 1 to position -i
            4. Moves motor 2 to position -i
        Reset to initial state
        Release the motors
    It's possible to change the delay between steps with the 'delay' argument
    '''
```

## /bin/rpistepper
`rpistepper` is a shell for controlling the motors. It provides all the methods in the `Motor` class. All the commands are documented in the shell.
It's possible to pipe a list of commands to the shell:
```bash
rpistepper < sample.stp
        or
cat sample.stp | rpistepper
```
Invoking `rpistepper` with `-g` flag will open a GUI application with similar functionality
