This is a simulation for creating a worm that find it's food using [two neurons](https://phys.org/news/2018-07-reveals-complex-math-worms-food.html).
The worm has a two perceptron network that hopefully that leads it to the food.
The worms are trained genetically, so if you leave them training long enough they
should learn how how to find the food.

## Suggested Improvements/Bugs

1.  Slow iterations when there's too many objects in the screen (Grijó). **another day**
2.  ~~It's not mobile friendly/Other resolutions (Alcalá/Damas/Agostinho).~~
3.  ~~Check `monospace` font (Damas).~~
4.  ~~Update graph scale (Alcalá).~~
5.  ~~Color families (Alcalá).~~
6.  ~~Add feedback for high *eaten* percentage (Alcalá).~~
7.  ~~Adjust font sizes (Agostinho).~~~~
8.  ~~Error on first load (Dani).~~

Thank you guys for testing
