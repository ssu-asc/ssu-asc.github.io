By the end of 2016 I was working on this [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for
my website. What I wanted was somewhere to put my projects, crazy ideas and a portfolio.
I left this project and my portfolio unmaintained for two years and then I decided
mess with it a little. It ended up like this:

I added some features and published it's [RubyGem](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-theme-potato-hacker).
But I wasn't expecting that in the same day I would have *130 downloads*. I don't know the kind of traffic that jekyll themes have, but I know that it isn't normal
for my repositories <span style="font-size: 2em;">ðŸ˜‚</span>.

Feel free to visit and use the theme. Here's the [GitHub Page]( https://github.com/luxedo/jekyll-theme-potato-hacker)
and the [RubyGem](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-theme-potato-hacker).
