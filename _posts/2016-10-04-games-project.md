Last month I've been working on some retro games. I managed to release 3 games:

Since it was quite fun to do them, I had the idea of making increasingly more challenging games up until remaking Doom.
I'm listing some games that I find interesting to remake:

* ~~Spacewar!~~ - done!
* ~~Asteroids~~ - done!
* ~~PONG~~ - done!
* Hamurabi
* Collosal Cave Adventure
* Lunar Lander
* The Oregon Trail
* Tetris
* E.T the Extra-Terrestrial
* Pac-Man
* Space Invaders
* Donkey Kong
* Pokemon
* Super Mario Bros
* TopGear
* Street Fighter
* Wolfenstein/Doom

I included games for their historical significance and also because of their different genres. Well see how far on the list I can go.
